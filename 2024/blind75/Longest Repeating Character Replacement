You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.

Example 2:

Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
There may exists other ways to achieve this answer too.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 105
    s consists of only uppercase English letters.
    0 <= k <= s.length

Solution:-

class Solution {
    public int characterReplacement(String s, int k) {
        int arr[] = new int[26];
        int largestCount = 0, start = 0, maxCount = 0;
        for(int e = 0; e < s.length(); e++){
            arr[s.charAt(e) - 'A']++;
            // Get the largest count of a single, unique character in the current window.
            largestCount = Math.max(largestCount, arr[s.charAt(e) - 'A']);
            // We are allowed to have at most k replacements in the window...
            // So, if max character frequency + distance between beg and end is greater than k...
            // this means we have considered changing more than k charactres. So time to shrink window...
            // Then there are more characters in the window than we can replace, and we need to shrink the window...
            
            if(e - start + 1 - largestCount > k){
                arr[s.charAt(start) - 'A']--;
                start++;
            }
            maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, e - start + 1);
        }
        return maxCount;
    }
}
