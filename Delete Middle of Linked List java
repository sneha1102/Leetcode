Question:-
Given a singly linked list, delete middle of the linked list. For example, if given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5 then linked list should be modified to 1->2->4->5.
If there are even nodes, then there would be two middle nodes, we need to delete the second middle element. For example, if given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6 then it should be modified to 1->2->3->5->6.

Solution:-

/*
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;
    Node(int d)  { data = d;  next = null; }
}
*/

class Solution {
    Node deleteMid(Node head) {
        // This is method only submission.
        // You only need to complete the method.
        if(head == null || head.next == null){
            return null;
        }
        Node prev = null, slow = head, fast = head;
        
        while(fast != null && fast.next != null){
            prev = slow;
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        prev.next = slow.next;
        return head;
        
    }
}
