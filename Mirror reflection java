Question:-
There is a special square room with mirrors on each of the four walls. Except for the southwest corner, there are receptors on each of the remaining corners, numbered 0, 1, and 2.

The square room has walls of length p and a laser ray from the southwest corner first meets the east wall at a distance q from the 0th receptor.

Given the two integers p and q, return the number of the receptor that the ray meets first.

The test cases are guaranteed so that the ray will meet a receptor eventually.

Example 1:
Input: p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The ray meets receptor 2 the first time it gets reflected back to the left wall.

Example 2:

Input: p = 3, q = 1
Output: 1


Solution:-
Let p = 3, q = 2
So, this problem can be transformed into finding ext * p = reflection * q, where
ext = the number of room extension + 1.
reflection = the number of light reflection + 1.

//     ext is even & reflection is odd => return 0.
//     ext is odd & reflection is odd => return 1.
//     ext is odd & reflection is even => return 2.
//     The case m is even & n is even is impossible. Because in the equation m * q = n * p, if m and n are even, we can divide both m and n by 2. Then, m or n must be odd.

class Solution {
    public int mirrorReflection(int p, int q) {
        int ext = q, ref = p;
        // handle both even case
        while(ext % 2 == 0 && ref % 2 == 0){
            ext /= 2;
            ref /= 2;
        }
        if(ext % 2 == 0 && ref % 2 == 1){
            return 0;
        }
        if(ext % 2 == 1 && ref % 2 == 1){
            return 1;
        }
        if(ext % 2 == 1 && ref % 2 == 0){
            return 2;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
