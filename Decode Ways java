Question:-
A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:

'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"

To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, "11106" can be mapped into:

    "AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
    "KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)

Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06" cannot be mapped into 'F' since "6" is different from "06".

Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).

Example 2:

Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).

Example 3:

Input: s = "06"
Output: 0
Explanation: "06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06").

 

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 100
    s contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).


Solution:-

class Solution {
    public int numDecodings(String s) {
        if(s.length() == 0 || s.charAt(0) == '0')
            return 0;
        // will be range from 1 - 9 so only one way possible
        if(s.length() == 1)
            return 1;
        // since we have one solution for first one so 1
        int prevCount = 1, prevPrevCount = 1;
        // we will start from second element
        for(int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++){
            //prev digit
            int prev = s.charAt(i) - '0';
            // prev to prev digit
            int prevToPrev = (s.charAt(i - 1) - '0') * 10 + prev;
            // from current element possible ways = 0
            int count = 0;
            // first case when element is in range 1 to 9
            if(prev > 0){
                count += prevCount;
            }
            // second case when element is in range 10 - 26
            if(prevToPrev >= 10 && prevToPrev <= 26){
                count += prevPrevCount;
            }
            prevPrevCount = prevCount;
            prevCount = count;
        }
        return prevCount;
    }
}
