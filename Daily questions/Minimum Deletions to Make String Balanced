You are given a string s consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b'​​​​.

You can delete any number of characters in s to make s balanced. s is balanced if there is no pair of indices (i,j) such that i < j and s[i] = 'b' and s[j]= 'a'.

Return the minimum number of deletions needed to make s balanced.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aababbab"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can either:
Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 2 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aaabbb"), or
Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 3 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aabbbb").

Example 2:

Input: s = "bbaaaaabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: The only solution is to delete the first two characters.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 105
    s[i] is 'a' or 'b'​​.


Solution:-

class Solution {
    public int minimumDeletions(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] f = new int[n + 1];
        int b = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            if (s.charAt(i - 1) == 'b') {
                f[i] = f[i - 1];
                ++b;
            } else {
                f[i] = Math.min(f[i - 1] + 1, b);
            }
        }
        return f[n];
    }
}
