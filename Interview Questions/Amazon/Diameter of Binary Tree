Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

 

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1

 

Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
    -100 <= Node.val <= 100


Solution:-

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

        if (node == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        int lh = height(node.left, diameter);
        int rh = height(node.right, diameter);
        diameter[0] = Math.max(diameter[0], lh + rh);
        return 1 + Math.max(lh, rh);
    }
